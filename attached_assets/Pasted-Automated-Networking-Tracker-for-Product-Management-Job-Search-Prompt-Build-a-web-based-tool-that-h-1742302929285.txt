Automated Networking Tracker for Product Management Job Search
Prompt:
Build a web-based tool that helps track networking connections automatically. The tool should allow users to input a contact's name, current company, and last conversation date, then automate the following actions:

Core Features:
LinkedIn Profile Fetching

Automatically retrieve and store the person's LinkedIn profile.
Follow-up Reminders

Schedule a reminder for the user to reach out again based on a chosen timeframe (e.g., 2 weeks, 1 month).
Job Search Automation

Scan tracked companies' career pages daily for open Product Manager roles (or other user-specified job titles).
Notify the user at 7 AM EST if any relevant jobs are posted.
Recent News Aggregation

Collect and display relevant recent news related to any companies the contact has previously worked for.
Career History Tracking

Log all previous companies where the contact has worked (based on LinkedIn data).
Meeting Log & Call Notes Storage

Store details of where and when the user initially met the contact.
Upload a Word document (.docx) with call notes, and the system will:
Extract the text and store it in the contactâ€™s profile.
Allow for searching within notes for quick reference.
Advanced Networking Insights:
Target Company & Role Matchmaking
User can add a list of companies they are interested in working at.
User can add a list of job titles they are interested in.
The tool will analyze all networking connections and highlight valuable connections based on:
GOLD-tier connection: Contact has the same or a similar job title AND works at one of the userâ€™s target companies.
SILVER-tier connection: Contact works at a target company (but may not have a matching title).
These insights should be highlighted in the dashboard and daily email notification.
Daily Notifications (7 AM EST)
New job postings from tracked companies.
Follow-up reminders for networking contacts.
Recent company news updates.
Gold & Silver networking opportunities (who to reach out to).
Summary of recent call notes from uploaded documents.
Tech Stack Recommendations:
Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Node.js
Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup or Scrapy (for job postings & news)
LinkedIn Automation: LinkedIn API or Google Search scraping
Google Calendar API: For scheduling follow-ups
Email/Notification System: Twilio, SendGrid, Firebase Cloud Messaging
Database: PostgreSQL, Firebase, or MongoDB for storing contacts and job postings
Document Processing: Python-docx (for extracting text from .docx files)
Frontend: React (for an interactive dashboard)
This tool will act as your personalized job search & networking assistant, automatically logging your call notes, keeping you updated on opportunities and key people to reconnect with.

OK this is great - now help me break this into bite size pieces to feed to replit and bolt and recommend that best way to get this coded up

Breaking Down the Automated Networking Tracker Into Bite-Sized Development Tasks
Since you want to build this on Replit and use tools like Bolt (for AI-assisted development), we should break the project into modular, manageable steps that can be coded up incrementally.
